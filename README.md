# Marketplais

Marketplais is a personal project aimed at creating a fully functional e-commerce marketplace web-application. Inspired by my own experience wtih Facebook Marketplace, the project's primary objective is to offer a more streamlined alternative while keeping essential features and ease of use. With Marketplais, users can create item listings with detailed seller information, item descriptions, pricing, categories, and an accompanying image. The web-app has a functioning account management system (created with Django's authentication system), allowing users to easily create accounts, log in, and log out as needed. Marketplais also implements the Stripe API to facilitate secure and seamless item purchases and sales. To promote effective communication between users, a built-in direct messaging system is integrated, enabling buyers and sellers to contact one another. Users also have a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of all their item listings, and an inbox that makes message management easy. With convenient search functionality and category-based filters, users can browse the inventory and quickly find items that match their preferences. Ultimately, this project's focus on user experience, functionality, and clean design help to create this web-app.
