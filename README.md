# Marketplais

Marketplais is a personal project aimed at creating a fully functional e-commerce marketplace web-application. Inspired by my own experience wtih Facebook Marketplace, the project's primary objective is to offer a streamlined and visually appealing alternative while ensuring essential features and ease of use. With Marketplais, users can create item listings, including detailed seller information, item descriptions, pricing, categories, and an accompanying image. The platform boasts a robust account management system, allowing users to easily create accounts, log in, and log out as needed. Marketplais also implements the Stripe API to facilitate secure and seamless item purchases and sales. To promote effective communication between users, a built-in direct messaging system is integrated, enabling buyers and sellers to contact one another. Users also have a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of all their item listings, and an intuitive inbox that streamlines message management. With convenient search functionality and category-based filters, users can browse and quickly find items that match their preferences. This project's focus on user experience, functionality, and modern design ensures a remarkable e-commerce platform.
