# Marketplais

Marketplais is a personal project aimed at creating a fully functional e-commerce marketplace web-application. Inspired by my own experience wtih Facebook Marketplace, the project's primary objective is to offer a streamlined and visually appealing alternative while ensuring essential features and ease of use. With Marketplais, users can effortlessly create item listings, including detailed seller information, item descriptions, pricing, categories, and an accompanying image. The platform boasts a robust account management system, allowing users to easily create accounts, log in, and log out as needed. Marketplais also implements the Stripe API to facilitate secure and seamless item purchases and sales. To promote effective communication between users, a built-in direct messaging system is integrated, enabling buyers and sellers to connect effortlessly. Users can enjoy a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of all their item listings, while an intuitive inbox streamlines message management. With convenient search functionality and category-based filters, users can quickly find items that match their preferences. Marketplais is developed using a solid tech stack, including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Django serving as the core framework. The project's focus on user experience, functionality, and modern design ensures a remarkable e-commerce platform.
